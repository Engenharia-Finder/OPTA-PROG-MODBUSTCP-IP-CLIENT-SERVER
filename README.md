# OPTA-PROG-MODBUSTCP-IP-CLIENT-SERVER
This programming establishes Modbus TCP/IP communication between two OPTA'S, one being the server and the other client. By giving a command to the OPTA client, the OPTA server will receive and activate LED D0. Sending and receiving data can be viewed on the serial monitor for each schedule.
